  <h3><a href="http://www.gamesbyangelina.org/">Michael Cook</a></h3>
  <p>Mike has somehow managed to one-up the average Computing student, both by
  actually ending up making games for a living and by doing so using his AI
  protege to do all the heavy lifting. Mike's PhD, as part of the Computational
  Creativity Group at Imperial, is hugely interesting both from a scientific and
  a philosophical perspective. If you are looking for some food for thought,
  his website is always a good bet.</p>
  <h3><a href="http://ben.dartoxia.com/">Ben Gazzard</a></h3>
  <p>When I started at my job, Ben was one of the unfortunate souls who I
  pestered with questions on a too-frequent basis for the first few weeks. He not
  only had answers but was gracious enough to not get visibly annoyed with me. As he
  says on his website, there isn't much to be seen there at the moment, but hopefully
  more links towards his homepage will prompt him to update it more regularly.</p>
  <h3><a href="http://richardharr.is/">Richard Harris</a></h3>
  <p>Rich is a walking Perl encyclopedia, which is more than a little useful at workplace
  where Perl is the norm. His blog is basically the How Things Work of Perl, and explains
  the language's finer points really well.</p>
  <h3><a href="http://incoherency.co.uk/">James Stanley</a></h3>
  <p>James always has an interesting project up his sleeve, and unfortunately doesn't
  write about them often enough. Two cases in point: he has the leading Google result
  for 'Countdown Solver' (a point he has repeatedly made over lunch) and also made 
  (perhaps less excitingly) 
  <a href="http://www.jes.xxx/francis">a web interface to my receipt printer</a>.</p>
