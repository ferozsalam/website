    <h3>The UK Immigration Party</h3>
    <p>
    The work of a weekend, I 'started' the UK Immigration Party on a whim some months
    ago. Although I started off with high ambitions, time taught me that I have neither
    the hours in the day nor the motivation to write fresh material for and promote
    a satirical website. Hosting is cheap, so I'm keeping it live - 
    <a href="http://www.ukip.im/migrant">take a look</a> and tell me if you like it.

    <h3>FSA food ratings [March 2013]</h3>
    <p>
    I've averaged out the Food Safety Ratings for virtually all the councils in Britain
    and posted them <a href="http://www.ferozsalam.com/food_ratings.html">here</a>. It was
    only a quick Sunday evening thing, so I haven't done much with the data, but it might
    be of casual interest to someone.

    <h3>Nope-inator</h3>
    <p>
    Tired of journalists lazily titling incredibly speculative articles with question 
    marks? <a href="https://t.co/yjS6xnX8OV">The Nope-inator tells it how it really is</a>. 
    Available only as a Chrome extension for now. Credit for the idea goes to 
    <a href="https://twitter.com/arcadia_eg0">@arcadia_eg0</a>.
    </p>
    <h3>Other</h3>
    <p>
    I started writing regularly using my 
    <a href="http://www.medium.com/@ferozsalam">Medium account</a>, but I am currently working on
    a statically built site for my writing that I host myself, so the actual writing has taken a 
    back seat for now.
    I'm also working on getting Brother Francis, my Brother receipt printer, to a state where
    it could legitimately be my own homebrew <a href="http://bergcloud.com/littleprinter/">
    Little Printer</a>. When it's in more of a usable state, I will link to the code from here.
