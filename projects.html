    <h3>The UK Immigration Party</h3>
    The UK Immigration Party is currently my biggest time-sink; trying to explain it 
    seriously would probably destroy any humour it has, so you're better off simply
    <a href="http://www.ukip.im/migrant">visiting</a> and forming your own opinions.
    Don't forget to check out <a href="http://news.ukip.im">The Migrant Herald</a> for
    all the latest UK Immigration Party news.
    <h3>FSA food ratings [March 2013]</h3>
    I've averaged out the Food Safety Ratings for virtually all the councils in Britain
    and posted them <a href="http://www.ferozsalam.com/food_ratings.html">here</a>. It was
    only a quick Sunday evening thing, so I haven't done much with the data, but it might
    be of casual interest to someone.
    <h3>Nope-inator</h3>
    Tired of journalists lazily titling incredibly speculative articles with question 
    marks? <a href="https://t.co/yjS6xnX8OV">The Nope-inator tells it how it really is</a>. 
    Available only as a Chrome extension for now. Credit for the idea goes to 
    <a href="https://twitter.com/arcadia_eg0">@arcadia_eg0</a>.
    <h3>Other</h3>
    It has taken me roughly a year after graduation to get back to writing again; 
    mostly it's on the UK Immigration Party 'blog' linked above, but I do plan on posting 
    somewhat regularly to my <a href="http://www.medium.com/@ferozsalam">Medium account</a>.
    I'm also working on getting Brother Francis, my Brother receipt printer, to a state where
    it could legitimately be my own homebrew <a href="http://bergcloud.com/littleprinter/">
    Little Printer</a>. When it's in more of a usable state, I will link to the code from here.
