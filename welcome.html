<h2>A brief introduction</h2>
<p>
Hi, I'm Feroz. I'm a software engineer or a computer scientist, 
depending on who you ask. I recently graduated with an MEng in Computing from 
<a href="http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/">Imperial College London</a>. 
</p>
<p>
I'm planning to put up 
some more information on the specific areas of Computing that interest me in the 
near future; at present I work on internet security (specifically anti-phishing services) 
at <a href="http://www.netcraft.com">Netcraft</a>. I have previously worked at 
<a href="http://orange.jobs/site/en-innovation-rd/index.htm">France Telecom</a> on network security,
and at Imperial College, as part of the 
<a href="http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/urop">UROP</a> and as a tutor to first year students in programming.
</p>
<p>
When I'm not working on code, I'm usually writing. I worked on the student paper
at Imperial College for a few years, and was the Technology Editor for my final
two years there. You can find some of my writing <a href="http://felixonline.co.uk/user/fa608/">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
In addition, I wrote a one-off piece for Denizens, which was (very surprisingly)
picked up for publication by OUP in 
<a href="http://www.oup.com/oxed/international/ibdiploma/englishb/">an English textbook for IB students</a>.
</p>
<p>
At the moment (when not at work) I am taking lessons in and teaching myself Arabic, as well as
planning my next writing project.
