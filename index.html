      Hi, I'm Feroz. I'm a software engineer or a computer scientist, 
      depending on who you ask. I recently graduated with an MEng in Computing from 
      <a href="http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/">Imperial College London</a>. 
      </p>
      <p>
      At present I work on internet security (specifically anti-phishing services) 
      at <a href="http://www.netcraft.com">Netcraft</a>. I have previously worked at 
      <a href="http://orange.jobs/site/en-innovation-rd/index.htm">France Telecom</a> on network security,
      and at Imperial College, as part of the <a href="http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/urop">UROP</a> 
      and as a tutor to first year students in programming.
      </p>
      <p>
      When I'm not working on code, I enjoy writing. I worked on the student paper
      at Imperial College for a few years, and was the Technology Editor for my final
      two years there. You can find some of my writing <a href="http://felixonline.co.uk/user/fa608/">here</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
      Apart from work and writing, I'm usually at work on one of my <a href="http://www.ferozsalam.com/projects.html">projects</a>
      or learning Arabic.
      </p>
